# BASIC AND INTERMEDIATE PYTHON EXAMPLES

Various code snippets in python to give you a basic understanding of the workings of one of if not the simplest programming language(s) out there. This repo was born out of an inspiration from https://github.com/ichtrojan/go-practice which is a fine collection of examples in the go programming language. Being a contributor to this repo I thought I'd make a python clone of it.

## Running the examples
Git clone https://github.com/ozombo/python-examples.git

cd python-examples
python3 filename.py
